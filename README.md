# geografieliberec.cz
Official repository of the website geografieliberec.cz, which is my diploma thesis.
https://geografieliberec.cz

# Launch
The website will be launched by 1. 8. 2020.

# README HERE
Everything that is needed can be found in following folders, mainly **root** and **google_disk**.
- **root** the whole folder from remote computer where all the coding was done
- **google_disk** part of the folder where the text of thesis was stored (backed up).

Running all *.ipynb* files
- files that begin with **000** are just additional files that were used in order to clasify groups while creating legends for maps.
- 001*, 002*, and 003* are for converting, merging, droping and rounding data/columns from *.csv files*

# FOLDERs description

### beta_works folder
This folder represents what has been done and completed so far.
Basically, everything works just fine; however, some data will be added and new maps generated.

### data_extra folder
Contains extra data which may come in hand when extending the whole thing.

### google_disk folder
Mirrors some files that are in **root** folder and was used as a transition point between hypervspssdeb (Jupyter PC) and geografieliberec (portal PC)

### root folder
In order to make it a bit cleaner all *.ipynb* files, which are required for Bokeh interactive maps, were moved into */root/bokeh_sluzby_temp* (from /root/*)
